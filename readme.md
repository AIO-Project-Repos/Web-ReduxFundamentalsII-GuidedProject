# How to Run this App
  * Clone repository.
  * Run `npm install` or `yarn`.
  * Run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
  * Run `npm test` or `yarn test`.
  * Serve `index.html` using `live-server` or similar.

# Objectives
  * Learn the fundamentals of Redux.

# Requirements
We need `node` & `npm`, as well as packages `live-server` and `eslint` installed _globally_. VSCode's `eslint` extension is recommended. Command line commands are run inside the project folder. This guide uses npm but should work the same using yarn.

# Steps

## App.jsx
  * Explain the different moving parts.
  * Flesh out one reducer, let students do the other.
  * Ask the students to use `combineReducers`.
  * Flesh out two action creators, let students do the other.
